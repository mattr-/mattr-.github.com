title: Updates to rack-jekyll are coming soon!
---

# {{ page.title }}

Adão Raul's [rack-jekyll](https://github.com/adaoraul/rack-jekyll) gem
is a great piece of Rack middleware to serve out Jekyll sites using any
Rack compatible app server. 

Sadly, rack-jekyll on RubyGems is seriously outdated. Prior to about a
week ago, the master branch on GitHub was using Jekyll 0.11, which is
few months out of date now. 

Fortunately, the pull requests I've submitted to update rack-jekyll to
Jekyll 0.12 and to update the other gems that rack-jekyll uses have been
merged into master. I've also been given push access to the repo so that
I can make sure the Jekyll support stays up to date as possible.

I've also sent an email asking for a new release, and offering to help
push it out to RubyGems if Adão so chooses to have me do that. Hopefully
I'll hear back soon and we can get a much needed update to rack-jekyll
done!
