# Open Source

I've been a contributor to open source software for more than 20 years. While
my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/mattr-) has my most recent open source
work, here's a timeline of other notable contributions I've made.

**November 2002**: First email to an open source project. This particular
email was to a KDE mailing list. KDE is a graphical desktop environment (a la
macOS or Windows) for *nix based systems.

**January 2003**: First patch submission to an open source project. I
submitted a patch to the Linux from Scratch project to update their
instructions for building a piece of software called Ghostscript, which can be
used to render PDFs on Linux systems

**2003 - 2011**: Heavy contributor to the KDE project. I often did bug triage,
worked on an instant messenger program (Kopete), the KDevelop IDE and
volunteered on the sysadmin team as well.

**2006, 2007, 2008, 2011**: Mentor for KDE in the Google Summer of Code program
