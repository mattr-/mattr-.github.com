title: Janky 0.11 out! Now with support for Slack!
---

# {{ page.title }} 

Hi there! I'm excited to announce that Janky 0.11 is out! The highlight
of this release is support for [Slack], thanks to Mathias Bartmann!

We've also converted the Room IDs from integers to strings in order to
improve chat room support, so you'll want to make sure you follow the
upgrade instructions [in the
README](https://github.com/github/janky#upgrading).

This release also marks my first as Janky's maintainer after taking over
the project earlier in the year. Thanks to the folks at GitHub for the
support in my taking over their project.
