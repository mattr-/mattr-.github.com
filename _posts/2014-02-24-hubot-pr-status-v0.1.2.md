title: hubot-pr-status 0.1.2 released
layout: post
---
I just pushed v0.1.2 of hubot-pr-status to npmjs.org. hubot-pr-status is
a little hubot script that lets you check the status of a PR on GitHub.

hubot-pr-status is an extraction of a small script I wrote for
[Hyde](https://github.com/jekyll/hyde), Jekyll's campfire bot.
[Parker](http://parkermoo.re) extracted it for all the world to enjoy.
It's still a bit raw at the moment, but [please submit an
issue](https://github.com/jekyll/hubot-pr-status/issues/new) if you see
something that needs a bit of love.
