# {{ page.title }} 

[Robin](http://robin-dupret.com), [Vicent](http://vmg.im) ,and I are
happy to announce the release of Redcarpet 3.0.0! We've got the usual
line up of goodies to talk about, so let's get to the good stuff.

# Backwards Compatibility

We've removed support for Ruby 1.8.x in this release. If you still need
Ruby 1.8.x support, then you'll need to stick with Redcarpet 2.3.0.

We've also removed the sundown submodule that was included in the
Redcarpet codebase. Sundown has been deprecated for some time and all
the code has been included in the redcarpet repository for awhile as
well. So long Sundown and thanks for all the fish.

# New features

## Highlight support

We've got a new option you can pass to the `Redcarpet::Markdown` object:
`:highlight`. This feature will let you use wrap a bit of text in a pair
of equals signs and Redcarpet will generate markup that will cause it to
be highlighted. If you want to use this option, you can use the
following Ruby code:

```ruby
markdown = Redcarpet::Markdown.new(Redcarpet::Render::HTML, :highlight => true)
```

to render the following markdown

```
This is ==highlighted== text, yo.
```

as

```html
This is <mark>highlighted</mark> text, yo.
```

Thanks to Sam Soffes for contributing this. If you want to see it in
action before you give it a try, check out [Sam's
blog](http://sam.roon.io).


# Bug fixes

We've fixed several issues in the Redcarpet codebase in this release.
Here are some of the highlights:

 - Fixed an issue where mixing code spans and emphasis mangled the output ([#135] and [#190])
 - Fixed an issue where nested parenthesis in a link didn't render correctly ([#237])
 - Fixed an issue where FTP URIs were misidentified as email links when using autolinking ([#170])
 - Fixed an issue where emphasis inside parenthesis was not parsed correctly ([#256])
 - Fixed an issue where HTML comments were being needlessly escaped ([#268])

Thanks to Robin Dupret for fixing all of these!


### Wrapping this up

We're really excited about Redcarpet 3.0.0 and hope you enjoy using it
as much as we enjoyed making it. If you have any issues, please feel
free to [file an issue] and we'll take a look at it.

Thanks!
