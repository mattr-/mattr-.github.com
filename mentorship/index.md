# Mentorship

I believe mentorship is important. For the last four years, I've been
mentoring at [Turing School of Software & Design](https://turing.io). Through
Turing's mentoring program, I've helped more than a dozen students achieve
their goal of becoming a software developer. These students have gone on to
begin amazing careers in backend development, frontend development, developer
advocacy, devops, and other roles across the whole entire spectrum of tech.
It has been a privilege to have been a part of their journey.

As a mentor, I focus on a few different areas based on a mentee's needs. These areas include:

- Testing techniques
- Software design
- Resume and job search help
- CS fundamentals

Last and certainly not least, another avenue of support I provide as a mentor
is emotional support for those who want/need it. My mentees know that if they
need my time they can call me, that I will listen to their struggles, and
do what I can to help them even if it's not always about their code.
