# Mentorship

I believe mentorship is important. Between 2014 and 2018, I mentored students new to software development at [Turing School of Software & Design](https://turing.io). Through Turing's mentoring program, I've helped more than a dozen students achieve their goal of becoming a software developer. These students have gone on to begin amazing careers in backend development, frontend development, developer advocacy, and devops, and other roles across the whole entire spectrum of tech. It has been a privilege to have been a part of their journey. As a mentor, I focus on a few different areas based on a mentee's needs. These areas include:

- Testing techniques
- Software design
- Resume and job search help
- CS fundamentals

Last and certainly not least, another avenue of support I provide as a mentor is emotional support for those who want/need it. My mentees know that if they need my time they can call me, that I will listen to their struggles, and do what I can to help them even if it's not always about their code.

After a short break from formal mentoring, I joined GitHub's formal engineering mentorship program as a mentor in 2023. With a focus on helping engineers across all levels of their career take their careers to the next level, I've coached half a dozen individuals on the next steps to take in their career.
