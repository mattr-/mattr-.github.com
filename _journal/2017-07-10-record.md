Spent the first part of my morning fighting with Nokogiri and macOS to
get the `github-pages` gem updated so I could actually start this thing.
Fun :disappointed:

I'm feeling pretty disappointed in the processes that are in place for
companies that have to comply to HIPAA and SOX. These are not new
feelings but perhaps these are at the forefront because now they're
going to start affecting me more and more and I have no control and
seemingly have no ability to influence those processes either.

In fact, this feeling of having no ability to influence the internal
processes of the organization I work for is something I've been feeling
more and more. More to come on this.
